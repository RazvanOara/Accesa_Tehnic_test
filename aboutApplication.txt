     This is a basic gamification of swimming.
      Each player have tokens, named 'goggles' and can earn points, wich can be only earned by completing
challenges.Each challenge gives a player a number of 25 points, wich cannot be changed; tokens to be earn
are choosed by the user who create the challenge, ranging between 5-25.
       Players can also win badges, who are given for complete specific tasks like:adding one friend.
creating one challenge, complete challenges.
      Completing the challenges is a very minimal operation, the user only specifing if he done it.
Once a challenge is accepted, or completed, the user can no longer accept the challenge again, only
 if he cancel it.
     Users cand add to a friend list another users, however this is more like  a "folowing" list.
